            Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz
            opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no
            such
            thing as an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
            Nothing
            exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
            changes.
            That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
            translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that
            way.
            Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.
        </p>

            They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out of
            that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the
            person
            is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your
            world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

        <h3>The story</h3>

        <p>
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around
            to commiserate. They said, <span class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</span> The
            farmer said, <span class="farmer">“Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”</span> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild
            horses
            with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <span class="villagers">
                “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of
                events.
                You now have eight horses!”
            </span> The farmer again said, <span class="farmer">“Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg. The neighbors then said, <span class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</span> and the farmer responded, <span class="farmer">
                “Is it good? Is it bad? I
                don't know.”
            </span> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they
            rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <span class="villagers">
                “Isn’t that
                great!”
            </span>
            Again, he said,<span class="farmer"> “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.”</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell
            whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of
            the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        <h3>Conclusion </h3>
        <p>
            Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas.
            Let's not make a big deal out of it...
